I have to do a lot of legwork here, since Jekyll is pretty unfamiliar to me still, so I have to get used to the yaml-based metadata system and all that. I implemented a basic categorical system with preset layouts for the categories, as outlined in online resources on Jekyll blogging. I also added categorical next-prev functionality, probably in a very cumbersome way. I’ll update this post with some details post haste, once I see that the system actually works. So, my CSS is broken when it comes to blockquotes- let’s fix that. So, it seems that choosing MDL as my frontend library is a bit of a chore. But never fear, I do like troubleshooting things. MDL is great for things like this, where I’m just trying to make a vary small thing and don’t really need anything heavy. MDL is easy to use, but a bit cumbersome with the JS, so let’s see what this looks like with the js taken out– Also, just a heads up, I’ll be switching over to Surface. It seems much much better, CSS only and just as good-looking! Holy shit! Yeah, tweaking this thing is just simply much more interesting than actually writing posts or having anything useful to say. That’s the curse of being into web design- it’s much more fun to build stuff than to use a finished platform. Written with StackEdit." />
