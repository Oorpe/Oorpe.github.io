<h3 id="dumb-words">Dumb words</h3>
<p>It’s a work in progress, okay? This is my github dev blog, to be filled with insightful commentary on software development, electronics tinkering and things I come up with off the top of my head.</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>I started building this blog-type deal as an exercise in writing and consistency. The schedule is that I want to write at least one post a day, every day, for as long as I possibly can. About anything, but hopefully mostly about tech stuff. I’ve wanted to be a good writer for a long time, but have been kind of foolishly waiting for inspiration to start working on it. This right here is my way of taking the bull by the horns, and good advice at face value.</p>
