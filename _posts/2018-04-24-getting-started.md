<p>Getting started on a new thing can be daunting. Here’s just a thing to test the category system I cobbled together.</p>
<p>I have to do a lot of legwork here, since Jekyll is pretty unfamiliar to me still, so I have to get used to the <code>yaml</code>-based metadata system and all that.</p>
<p>I implemented a basic categorical system with preset layouts for the categories, as outlined in online resources on Jekyll blogging. I also added categorical next-prev functionality, probably in a very cumbersome way. I’ll update this post with some details post haste, once I see that the system actually works.</p>
