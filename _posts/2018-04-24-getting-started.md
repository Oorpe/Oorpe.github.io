<p>Getting started on a new thing can be daunting. Here’s just a thing to test the category system I cobbled together.</p>
<p>I have to do a lot of legwork here, since Jekyll is pretty unfamiliar to me still, so I have to get used to the <code>yaml</code>-based metadata system and all that.</p>
<p>I implemented a basic categorical system with preset layouts for the categories, as outlined in online resources on Jekyll blogging. I also added categorical next-prev functionality, probably in a very cumbersome way. I’ll update this post with some details post haste, once I see that the system actually works.</p>

<p>So, it seems that choosing MDL as my frontend library is a bit of a chore. But never fear, I do like troubleshooting things. MDL is great for things like this, where I’m just trying to make a vary small thing and don’t really need anything heavy. MDL is easy to use, but a bit cumbersome with the JS, so  let’s see what this looks like with the js taken out–</p>

<p>Also, just a heads up, I’ll be switching over to Surface. It seems much much better, CSS only and just as good-looking! Holy shit!</p>

</ul>
<p>Yeah, tweaking this thing is just simply much more interesting than actually writing posts or having anything useful to say.</p>
<p>That’s the curse of being into web design- it’s much more fun to build stuff than to use a finished platform.</p>
